# API_MongoDB_Bookcase

THE BRIEF

Make a very simple Mongo database of your choosing. Serve up this data in an API.

If you feel ambitious, make a UI for your data.

THE PROJECT

Practicing what I had learned earlier today about Mongo databases, using RESTful routes.

Building on my experience of working with APIs, this time by creating my own, a place for readers to record their book collections.

Having a bit of fun with the aesthetic appearance of the form and data using CSS and HTML.

SCREENSHOTS

The bookcase without any books in it.
